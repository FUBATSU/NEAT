# NEAT: Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies
This Python code can be cut and pasted into Google Colab and run as is. It will output the current generation and the nodes and connections of the best neural network evolved at each improvemnt until it reaches the optimal solution. This is my first attempt at implementing a research paper from scratch.
